<body>
<div id='blank'>
    <p>
    This is a blank page. It is the simplest form of a liquid layout.
    </p>
</div>
<div id='main'>
    <div id='header'>
        <p>
        This is a header. It's a fairly standard device in most layouts. Click it to set toggle the layout between 1024x768 resolution and 1680x1050 resolution. If the display is set to liquid then this will do nothing.
        </p>
        <p>
        Current display state: <span>fixed</span><br />
        Current resolution: <span>1024x768</span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id='col1'>
        <p>
        This is the first column. Many people use it for a navigation sidebar. Click it to toggle it between fixed width and scaling width.
        </p>
        <p>
        Current state: <span>Scaling</span><br />
        Current width: <span>10%</span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id='col2'>
        <p>
        This is the second column. Most of the time it is used for the main content. You can drag its borders to resize it. It will keep the new size proportionate to the resolution.
        </p>
        <p>
        Current width: <span>90%</span><br />
        Current height: <span>80%</span>
        </p>
    </div>
    <div id='footer'>
        <p>
        This is a footer. It's about as standard as the header. Click it to toggle between fixed resolution or liquid displays.
        </p>
        <p>
        Current display state: <span>fixed</span>
